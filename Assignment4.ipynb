        "#THEORETICAL QUESTIONS\n",
        "1-What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that models software as a collection of interacting objects, which are instances of classes that combine data (properties) and the functions (methods) that operate on that data. OOP promotes modular, reusable, and maintainable code by using core principles like Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "2-What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class is a blueprint or template in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for creating objects. It provides a clear, reusable structure for defining the common properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that all objects of a certain type will possess.\n",
        "\n",
        "3-What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. While a class serves as a blueprint or template, an object is a concrete, real-world entity created from that blueprint that exists in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "- An object bundles together data (called attributes or properties) and behavior (called methods) into a single, self-contained unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "4-What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstraction:\n",
        "Abstraction is a design-level concept that focuses on hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. The goal is to simplify a complex system by presenting a clean, high-level interface to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation:\n",
        "Encapsulation is an implementation-level mechanism that bundles an object's data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, typically a class. Its primary goal is to protect the object's internal state from unintended or unauthorized access.\n",
        "\n",
        "5-What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dunder methods\" (or \"magic methods\") in Python are a special set of predefined methods that are named with a double underscore prefix and suffix (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__). They allow you to define how your custom classes interact with Python's built-in syntax, functions, and operators.\n",
        "\n",
        "These methods are not meant to be called directly. Instead, they are automatically invoked by the Python interpreter when a specific action or event occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "6-Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a new class (the subclass or child class) is created from an existing class (the superclass or parent class). The subclass automatically gains all the properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) of the superclass, which it can then reuse, extend, or override.\n",
        "\n",
        "This mechanism establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between the classes. For example, a Car is a Vehicle, so a Car class can inherit from a Vehicle class, gaining properties like speed and color while adding unique ones like numDoors.\n",
        "\n",
        "7-What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism, which comes from the Greek words for \"many\" and \"forms,\" is an OOP concept that allows an entity—be it a method or an object—to have different behaviors in different contexts. This capability provides flexibility, extensibility, and reusability in code.\n",
        "\n",
        "8-How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, encapsulation is achieved through a combination of naming conventions and a feature called name mangling, as Python does not have strict private access modifiers like Java or C++. Developers use prefixes to signal the intended visibility of class members, and name mangling provides a stronger, though not impenetrable, form of privacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "9-What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, the term constructor most commonly refers to the __init__ method. It is a special method automatically called when a new object (instance) of a class is created. Its primary purpose is to initialize the object's attributes with the values passed in at creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "10- What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Class methods :\n",
        "\n",
        "- Class methods are bound to the class itself, not to an instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Decorator: Defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "- First argument: They must have cls as their first parameter, which refers to the class object itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Access: Can access and modify class-level attributes and call other class methods, but cannot access instance-specific data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Common uses: Often used as factory methods to provide alternative ways of creating new instances of the class.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. However, in Python, method overloading is not supported natively in the same way it is in statically typed languages like Java or C++.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Because Python is a dynamically typed language, it does not distinguish between methods based on the number or type of their parameters. If you define multiple methods with the same name in a class, the later definition will simply overwrite the earlier ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "12- What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Method overriding is a feature in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in one of its superclasses. This is a core part of runtime polymorphism, as the version of the method that is executed depends on the object type calling it.\n",
        "\n",
        "13-What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The @property decorator in Python is a built-in feature that provides a \"Pythonic\" way to manage object attributes. It allows you to use methods for getting, setting, and deleting an attribute's value, while still accessing the attribute as if it were a public member variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "- This mechanism helps enforce encapsulation, a core OOP principle, by controlling how an attribute is accessed and updated, rather than allowing direct, unchecked modification.\n",

        "14-Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism is important in OOP because it promotes a high degree of code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability. It allows you to design systems that are easily adaptable and extensible without needing to modify existing code.\n",

        "\n",
        "- In Python, an abstract class is a blueprint for other classes that cannot be instantiated on its own. It is created to define a common interface and enforce a specific structure for all its subclasses. Abstract classes are a key part of implementing abstraction and polymorphism in object-oriented programming.\n",

        "\n",
        "The significance of super() in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Initializes parent classes' attributes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- It is commonly used in a subclass's __init__ constructor to call the __init__ method of the parent class. This ensures that inherited attributes are properly initialized without rewriting the initialization code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Facilitates code reuse:\n",
        "\n",
        "- When a child class overrides a parent's method, super() allows you to call the parent's version of the method. This lets you extend or modify inherited behavior rather than completely replacing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Enables cooperative multiple inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "- super() uses the Method Resolution Order (MRO) to determine which method to call next in the inheritance chain. This is vital for managing multiple inheritance, as it prevents methods from being called multiple times and ensures they are called in a consistent and predictable sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Avoids hardcoding parent class names:\n",
        "- By using super(), you don't need to explicitly name the parent class when calling its methods. This makes your code more flexible and easier to maintain, as you can change the class hierarchy without altering the method calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "21- What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",

This is useful for creating objects that act like stateful functions, such as counters or function factories. It is also the mechanism used to implement class-based decorators.
