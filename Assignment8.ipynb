        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Simple Linear Regression (SLR)** is a statistical technique used to study the **linear relationship between two variables**, where one variable is **independent (X)** and the other is **dependent (Y)**. It assumes that the change in the dependent variable can be explained by the change in the independent variable through a straight-line relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "The general mathematical equation of Simple Linear Regression is:\n",
        "\n",
        "Y = a + bX\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Y** = Dependent variable (output/result)\n",
        "* **X** = Independent variable (input/cause)\n",
        "* **a** = Intercept (value of Y when X = 0)\n",
        "* **b** = Regression coefficient or slope (rate of change of Y with respect to X)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Purpose of Simple Linear Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **To establish a relationship between variables**\n",
        "\n",
        "   SLR helps in understanding how one variable influences another. For example, it shows how sales depend on advertising expenditure.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **To predict future values**\n",
        "\n",
        "   Once the regression equation is formed, it can be used to predict the value of the dependent variable for a given independent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **To measure the strength and direction of the relationship**\n",
        "\n",
        "   The slope indicates whether the relationship is positive or negative and how strongly X affects Y.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **To analyze trends and patterns**\n",
        "\n",
        "   SLR is useful in identifying trends in data over time, such as population growth or demand forecasting.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **To support decision making**\n",
        "\n",
        "   It is widely used in business, economics, engineering, and social sciences to make informed decisions based on data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example\n",

        "Question 2: What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple Linear Regression works properly only when certain **assumptions** about the data are satisfied. These assumptions ensure that the results obtained from the regression model are **valid, reliable, and accurate**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Linearity**\n",
        "\n",
        "There must be a **linear relationship** between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y).\n",
        "This means that the change in Y should be directly proportional to the change in X and can be represented by a straight line.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Independence of Errors**\n",
        "\n",
        "The **errors (residuals)** should be independent of each other.\n",
        "This means that the error for one observation should not affect or be related to the error of another observation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance)**\n",
        "\n",
        "The variance of the errors should be **constant** for all values of X.\n",
        "In other words, the spread of residuals should remain the same across the regression line.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Normality of Errors**\n",
        "\n",
        "The residuals should be **normally distributed** with a mean of zero.\n",
        "This assumption is important for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **5. No Multicollinearity**\n",
        "\n",
        "In Simple Linear Regression, there should be **only one independent variable**.\n",
        "Therefore, multicollinearity (high correlation between independent variables) should not exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **6. No Outliers or Influential Points**\n",
        "\n",
        "The data should not contain extreme values (outliers) that can strongly influence the regression line and lead to misleading results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **7. Measurement Without Error**\n",
        "\n",
        "The independent variable (X) is assumed to be measured **without error**, and all errors are assumed to be present only in the dependent variable (Y).\n",
